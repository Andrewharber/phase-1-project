# Dog Backlogs

Dog Backlogs is your resource to dog rescues in the tri-state area. Fostering or adopting a dog can make an imperative difference in both the human's and animal's life. As a dog dad in New York City I find myself engaging with different communities more and more and leaving simple positive impacts on strangers days every time I walk my dog. There are thousands of resources and shelters across the nation but I wanted to create a simple database for people in the tri-state area to connect and interact with the right rescue for them. 

## Usage

Using the drop box menu to select your state you can access nearby rescues returning a list of information along with featured dogs to learn more on.

Along the bottom you can sign up to receive weekly updates to our 'happy tails' news letter which features a dog of the week with a bio and adoption stories if any.
